# Beginning OpenGL Game Programming

This directory is from my studies from the book Beginning OpenGL Game Programming. It will contains book examples, exercises and a day to day progress.

## TODO's

    - Finish rotating triangle, fix translate and rotate issues.

## Day One

    Chapters 1 - 2

    Well in this very first day I've read all the initial considerations and started to learn about one of the GLFW configurations, the rendering context. I also started to develop a simple application from chapter 2 example, a rotating triangle. I had some issues with it, the process of draw the triangle occurs without further problems, but the process of rotating the triangle have been very difficult, once the book is a little bit old and I am rewriting the example to GLFW and GLEW technologies it was already expected.

    I'll spent tomorrow morning trying to fix it, otherwise I will just let it behind and try to fix it some other day.

    I am also considering starts to study the book "Foundations of Game Engine Development, Volume 1 Mathematics" at the same time to be more familiarized with 3D maths.

## Day Two
