# Beginning OpenGL Game Programming

This directory is from my studies from the book Beginning OpenGL Game Programming. It will contains book examples, exercises and a day to day progress.

## Chapters Structure

By the pattern from the chapters of the book, we are going to have a section of exercises and a section of "On Your Own" where the reader should solve a problem using what he learned in the chapter. I'm not going to solve the exercises in the repository, once their are mostly theoric, but I'm going to upload all the "On Your Own" pratical exercises.

## Examples

The book had too many good examples, to demonstrate the funtionalities from OpenGL functions and how to apply them to game development. Altought examples are not essential, I'm going to do the most of them to practice and improve my understanding about OpenGL, but, how their are expandables, I'll not give priority to it, and finish it in fridays/saturdays.
