# Beginning OpenGL Game Programming

This directory is from my studies from the book Beginning OpenGL Game Programming. It will contains book examples, exercises and a day to day progress.

## Schedule

I'm doing my best to move forward everyday on the book progress, so the examples and exercises are going to be coded on the study days. On my first days I've noticed the necessity of the creation of two more days, so in total it's going to be three days, Study Day, Fixes Day and Features Day.

Studys Day it's a normal week day, where I'm going to study, learn and code examples and exercises. Small improves in the base project mey also happen too.

Fixes Day are going to be all the fridays, where I'm going to focus in solving small tasks, examples and bugs I've decided to postergate.

Features Day are going to be the entire weekend, where I'm going to focus in entire features or big implementations of something. So almost exclusively, the Features Day is focused on the improvement of the base project.

## Chapters Structure

By the pattern from the chapters of the book, we are going to have a section of exercises and a section of "On Your Own" where the reader should solve a problem using what he learned in the chapter. I'm not going to solve the exercises in the repository, once their are mostly theoric, but I'm going to upload all the "On Your Own" pratical exercises.

## Examples

The book had too many good examples, to demonstrate the funtionalities from OpenGL functions and how to apply them to game development. Altought examples are not essential, I'm going to do the most of them to practice and improve my understanding about OpenGL, but, how their are expandables, I'll not give priority to it, and finish it in fridays/saturdays.

## Fixes TODO's
- [ ] Review mouse position feature
	- [ ] Update function can fix
- [ ] Create a method to define which kind of projection we are going to use
	- [ ] Orthographic projections
	- [ ] Perspective projections
- [ ] Review the way we are defining the coordinate system in the base project. It might've be defined wrong.

## Features TODO's
- [ ] FOV on base project
- [ ] Core class to handle the application (decentralize it from Window class)
- [ ] Finish full screen configurations
    - [ ] Add escape key to altern between full screen and window
    - [ ] Nothing messing up on the screen
- [ ] Draw the new architecture, the way it is going to work with the Core class
