# Notes to improve development

## Libraries Build
    - Assimp. It doesn't look to be possible to use as the other Libraries 
    we've been using so far, so an alternative might be to compile it using 
    VSCode and then just import it into our code.

    - ImGUI. 

## Text Editor
    - Function signature(parameters) suggestion, it would help a lot, however 
    it seems to be more useful in a big project with pre defined and 
    configured properties, it might be a option to use when I decide to start 
    the development of the rendering engine.

    - Definition and references finder in the editor, it would be of great 
    help, althought I didn't have searched more about it, so I'm not sure if 
    depends on a fix and configured project as the function signature.

    - Improved nvim tabs.

## Process to build and run the project

    - Floating terminal would be good to improve the process of build and run 
    the application.
